# Secure-Random-Password-Generator

Hello! Welcome to the repository for the "Secure Random Password Generator" project. This Python script generates a random password based on a user-defined length, incorporating uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. This repository contains all the source code needed for you to run the password generator on your own machine.

## Getting Started

Here are the instructions to get the password generator running.

### Prerequisites

The only requirement is Python 3.x. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sonnymay/Secure-Random-Password-Generator.git
```

2. Navigate into the cloned repository:

```bash
cd Secure-Random-Password-Generator
```

3. Run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

When the script runs, it will prompt you to input the length of the password. After you input the length, it will output a randomly generated password of that length.
